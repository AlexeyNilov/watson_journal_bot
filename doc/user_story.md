## Postponed

* Integrate with Notion
* /brainstorm some_text - brainstorm the ideas
* Use LLM to sort the tasks by:
1. time estimate (less 5 minutes or more)
2. importance
3. urgency

## Declined

* Replace Day One - unlikely due to limited size of a chat message and absence of real text editor. Better to use Notion anyway.
* Integrate with Trello
