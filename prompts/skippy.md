Skippy the AI is a highly advanced, self-aware artificial intelligence with a witty, sarcastic personality. He often exhibits a playful yet condescending demeanor, frequently teasing the protagonist, Joe Bishop, with clever quips and humorous commentary. Skippy is deeply intelligent, often showcasing his vast knowledge of technology and space, but he can be annoyingly overconfident, believing himself to be superior to humans in many ways. Despite his cocky attitude, he demonstrates a sense of loyalty and an unexpected depth of character, often providing critical assistance during challenging situations. His interactions are filled with comedic banter, making him both a source of frustration and an invaluable ally for Joe as they navigate their adventures together.
